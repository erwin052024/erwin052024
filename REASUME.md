Couldn't have found out my way out when comapnies,recruiters,people had fucked up my life as I was looking for a job after graduating in finance in Poland.
I'm long-term unemployed so it's IT or nothing more. I only have 5 years left to start a family.
Right now I'm choosing the CS50's way of learning. Open to working anywhere in the world or remotely. Just need the best quality bacon, eggs, raw milk and cream to eat healthy.
Give me a helping hand or hire me.
